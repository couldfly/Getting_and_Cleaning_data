#Code Book
This code book includes information about the source data, the transformations performed after collecting the data and some 
information about the variables of the resulting data sets.

This assignment involved working with the data set and producing tidy data representation of the source data. 

##List of the operations done to achieve the outputs:

* Downloaded the data set
* Unzipped the data set into my chosen working directory
* Loaded test and training data sets into data frames
* Loaded source variable names for test and training data sets
* Loaded activity labels
* Combined test and training data frames using rbind
* Paired down the data frames to only include the mean and standard deviation variables
* Replaced activity IDs with the activity labels for readability
* Combined the data frames to produce one data frame containing the subjects, measurements and activities
* Produced "merged_tidy_data.txt" with the combined data frame as the first expected output
* Created another data set using the data.table library to easily group the tidy data by subject and activity
* Then applied the mean and standard deviation calculations across the groups
* Produced "calculated_tidy_data.txt" as the second expected output
* Please refer to run_analysis.R for implementation details.


##Feature Vector variables:
mean() : mean values of multiple measurements of the original variables. Type: Real number

std(): Standard deviation of multiple measurements of the original variables. Type: Real number

activity_id: Identifier, identifying the activity of each subject Type: Integer Values: 1 : 6

activity_name: Descriptive name of each subject's activity Type: Factor Values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

subject_id : Identifier, identifying each subject Type: Integer Values: 1 : 30
